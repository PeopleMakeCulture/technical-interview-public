# Prompt

Given a "book" and a string to search for, return an array of the character indices for every word in the book that begins with that string.

The book will be given as two things: a book id and a string of English text. The search should be case *insensitive*.

Follow-up: consider the possibility of repeated searches through the same book.

# Examples

```js
const book = {
  id: 1,
  text: 'Once upon a time, there was a book with words. The book had not been catalogued, but would catch the eyes of onlookers nonetheless.'
};

findWordsStartingWith(book, 'the'); // should return [ 18, 47, 97 ]
findWordsStartingWith(book, 'cat'); // should return [ 69, 91 ]
```

# Solutions

A naive solution involves simply looping through the text. This solution is O(n * m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the prefix.

Interviewees may instinctively move to use `includes`, `substring`, `indexOf`, or to check the prefix against a `slice` of the text. This is fine in practice, but in an interview setting only serves to show that you happen to have read the docs, not that you understand how these methods work under the hood. Steer them away from this approach and towards something like the solution below.

```js
function findWordsStartingWith (book, prefix) {
  const text = book.text.toLowerCase();
  prefix = prefix.toLowerCase();
  const finds = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < text.length - prefix.length; i++) {
    if (i !== 0 && text[i - 1] !== ' ') continue;
    for (let j = 0; j < prefix.length; j++) {
      if (prefix[j] !== text[i + j]) break;
      if (j + 1 == prefix.length) {
        finds.push(i);
      }
    }
  }
  return finds;
}
```

For repeated executions, precomputing a trie would be extremely helpful.

A trie is a tree-like structure that stores successive prefixes of a word.

While expensive at setup, this solution yields dividends in repeated lookups. Searching an existing trie is at most O(n), with n being the length of the prefix.

  prefix = prefix.toLowerCase();
  const trie = findOrCreateTrie(book);
  let node = trie;
  for (let i = 0; i < prefix.length; i++) {
    const char = prefix[i];
    node = node[char];
    if (!node) return [];
  }
  return node.indexes;
}
```
