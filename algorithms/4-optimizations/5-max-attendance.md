# Prompt

You had a party yesterday and a lot of people showed up.

Given an array of guest attendance objects for that day, determine the hour of the day (0 through 23) which had the greatest total attendance, and what that attendance was.

Each guest attedance object will look something like:

```js
{
  guestId: '8f1h812', // unique id per guest
  entryTime: 118341, // milliseconds since midnight
  exitTime: 7837432 // milliseconds since midnight
}
```

Follow-up: what was the most-attended range (in milliseconds), and how many people were present during that range.

# Examples

And for the follow-up:

```js
```
